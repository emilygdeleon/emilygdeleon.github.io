      Born and raised in the Chicagoland suburbs, I was deeply influenced by my
      Filipino heritage and the strong family values and traditions that came with
      it. Growing up in the US, I was fortunate enough to travel the world and
      experience new cultures firsthand. I’ve visited more countries and states
      than I can count and have a special love for the Netherlands, Argentina,
      Philippines, and Hawaii, which is a state I&#039;ve visited more than 20
      times!
      <br />
      <br />
      My educational journey led me to pursue opportunities that utilize my
      technical knowledge in consulting roles and client-facing positions,
      particularly those involving project management. I am passionate about
      technology for social good, biotechnology, women in tech and leadership,
      diversity, equity, and inclusion, ethical tech/data privacy, and
      technology-focused innovation and trends.
      <br />
      <br />
      Outside of my professional interests, I cherish spending time with family
      and friends, exploring downtown Chicago, listening to music, and attending
      festivals and shows. I am an avid follower of Formula 1 racing and have a
      keen interest in fashion.
      <br />
      <br />
      A unique aspect of my upbringing is my background in competitive
      cheerleading, where I competed at the state championship level. This
      experience taught me the importance of teamwork, how to cooperate with
      teammates from all walks of lifes, and how to leverage everyone’s strengths,
      long before my professional journey began. It also instilled in me the
      resilience to overcome hardships and the discipline to endure long,
      grueling, and physically demanding practices after long school days. I am
      forever grateful for this experience as I have been able to translate this
      strength to the workplace to be an effective team member and leader.
      <br />
      <br />
      Through my diverse experiences and passions, I have developed a deep
      appreciation for the complexity of our world and the incredible people
      within it. I approach each project with intention and ensure it aligns with
      my ethics, values and passions, driven by the unwavering belief that
      everything in life is attainable through hardwork.
