      Continuing work as a Management and Technology Consultant after a successful
      initial project in Medicare compliance and price transparency, I extensively
      researched evolving innovative data collection methods for pricing in the
      private health insurance sector. I strategically analyzed SQL queries to
      evaluate surgical procedure rates across five key US regions, aiding in
      database debugging and optimization. To achieve client objectives, I closely
      collaborated with professionals at all levels, from Staff to Partners,
      leveraging their industry expertise. I completed an extensive training
      program that included networking, mentorship, formal training, and personal
      growth, enabling immediate client value and contributing positively to the
      firm’s culture and community service efforts.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      As an Interim Project Manager, I oversaw vendor negotiations and managed a
      six-figure funded project from concept to enterprise-wide implementation.
      Using both coding expertise and no-code solutions, I enhanced operational
      efficiency by engineering front-end and back-end systems. I designed dynamic
      Power BI dashboards to track vehicle inspection and employee training
      compliance metrics, achieving a 16% increase in vehicle inspection
      compliance through semi-automatic intelligent data analysis. This initiative
      saved over 1,000 annual hours per Regional Safety Manager in the Fire
      Division and improved OSHA compliance. I developed a comprehensive
      Ergonomics Solution Sourcebook intranet site, accessed by over 40,000
      employees, to centralize ergonomic resources and best practices.
      Additionally, I created and piloted an automated Safety Lead Process,
      improving incident awareness and injury prevention strategies.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      My consultant journey began at the Staff level, where I was later promoted
      to Senior and subsequently selected as a Project Director. In this role, I
      directed a team of over 9 consultants for three different semester-long
      projects, managing client engagement and leading optimization efforts for
      Guardhat Inc.’s Safety and Inspection Manager IoT platform through targeted
      feature prioritization. I provided extensive consulting on market research
      and fostering a start-up culture at Guardhat Inc., consistently delivering
      high-level insights and impactful results. I generated and presented
      high-level quantitative and qualitative reports weekly, informing strategic
      decisions. My efforts were integral in surpassing Ascent Integrated
      Technology’s customer discovery outreach goals, successfully engaging
      prospective clients for pilot programs in incident command solutions.
      Additionally, I led the initiative to enhance user experience for the Blaze
      app, a GroupMe adjacent group messaging app, by maintaining direct and
      strategic communication with the founder, ensuring that our development
      efforts aligned with the vision and needs of our user base.
